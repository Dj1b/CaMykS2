# CaMykS 2

## What is CaMykS?

CaMykS is a CMS ("Content Management System"). More precisely, it's a tool used to build then manage and update a website. This is done online through a compatible web browser.

CaMykS is made to be the more flexible and ergonomic as possible into the two main steps of the lifetime of a website - building and managing.

After nearly 15 years using and evolving CaMykS in its first version, we decided to start working on a new version. CaMykS 2 is written from scratch, based on the same features that make CaMykS a success, but removing all the limitations and constraints it may have.

**CaMykS is currently in a building phase, and is far way from capable to do something concrete.**


## CaMykS features

CaMykS have several features that makes it powerful. It is multi-site, multilingual, performant, collaborative, flexible and plugin-based to allow easy customisation.

## Requirements

CaMykS is working on LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) or MAMP (Mac OS X/Apache/MySQL/PHP) systems.

We advise to suit the following versions:
* Apache 2.0+, with Rewrite module (Header module advised)
* PHP 5+ (version 5.6 or 7 advised), with curl, gd, mbstring, xml modules
* MySQL 5.5+

SQLite3 and PostgreSQL drivers are currently available in beta. They are working but incomplete, and may have some issues we haven't found yet.
Feel free to share your experience, and help us to finalise them.
